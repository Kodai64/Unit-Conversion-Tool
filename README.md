# Unit-Conversion-Tool
A simple unit conversion tool based on Python 3.7/ Tkinter library


History:
This is essentially my very first GUI program, I used it as a practice to write code based on Python/Tkinter library before building a more complex program that became TextPad.
However, I did not publish it here until recently.
